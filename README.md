<h2>Project Architecture 👨‍💻</h2>

The e-commerce project is built using Next.js with a statically generated site. The architecture follows a component-based structure, utilizing React components for features such as add to cart, delete from cart, single page, order summary, and payment detail. Static data is employed for product information, eliminating the need for a dynamic backend. The application state is managed efficiently through Next.JS's internal state and context API. Routing is seamlessly handled by Next.js, providing smooth navigation between pages. Overall, the project maintains a clean and modular architecture, leveraging Next.js for its performance benefits and simplicity in building static e-commerce applications;
